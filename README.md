# ChatRoomServer
This project also contains the client side project.


SOLID design principles:

1. Dependency inversion principle;

	An example of this in my project is where I use the interface IRunClient to create abstraction in the client class.

2. Single responsibility principle.

	My example for this is the EndMessage method in the Client class. It does one thing which is close the client.
